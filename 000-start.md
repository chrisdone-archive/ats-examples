## Examples from Introduction to Programming in ATS

This is my catalogue of all the examples and concepts described in the
book *Introduction to Programming in ATS*.

### Motivation

I'm learning ATS, so I thought I would catalogue my learnings into a
sort of cheatsheet as I go through the book. I and other (potential)
learners can use it as a quick reference.

The code samples are formatted according to my Haskelly aesthetic. ATS
is notorious for looking very ugly. I suspect that this is almost
entirely due to the crazy way in which the main ATS developers,
including the author of *Introduction to Programming in ATS*, Hongwei
Xi, format their code. In reformatting these code samples, I hope to
prove to others (and myself) that ATS can be beautiful.

### Compiling the examples

Compile with:

    $ atscc foo.dats

Run with:

    $ ./a.out

or:

    $ atscc foo.dats -o foo

Run with:

    $ ./foo
