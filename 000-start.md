## Examples from Introduction to Programming in ATS

This is my catalogue of all the examples and concepts described in the
book *Introduction to Programming in ATS*.

### Motivation

I'm learning ATS, so I thought I would catalogue my learnings into a
sort of cheatsheet as I go through the book. I and other (potential)
learners can use it as a quick reference.

The code samples are formatted according to my Haskelly aesthetic. ATS
is notorious for looking very ugly, but I've attempted to make it
pretty. For comparison
[see here](https://gist.github.com/chrisdone/3cbda530e525addb1dc3).

### Compiling the examples

Compile with:

    $ atscc foo.dats

Run with:

    $ ./a.out

or:

    $ atscc foo.dats -o foo

Run with:

    $ ./foo
